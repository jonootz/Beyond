        <h1>RACE GENDER MEDIA EFFECTS</h1>
        <h2>Dicussion 2:</h2>
        <p>After watching "Latinos Beyond Reel" and reading,"Hispanics in Film and Television Entertainment" answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What were some of the stereoypes of Latinos discussed in the film and reading?<ol><li>Some of the stereotypes of Latinos discussed in the film and reading were that Latinos were the lazy Mexican, the Latin lover, the criminal or greaser. Greasers were portrayed alot as hateful, cold-blooded bandits with overemphasized accents. Most commonly male Latinos are portrayed as "hyper-violent" and "barbaric" whereas Latinas where portrayed as "hyper-sexual" and "volatile" (44:00), and of course as spitfires. Over the years the stereotypical bandito roles turned into more modern Latin American dictator type roles, or drug lords, and gang bangers.</li></ol></li>
            <li>What were the origins of some of the early images?<ol><li>Early images appeared to come from newspaper cartoons regarding how Mexicans were fighting against Western settlers to defend their land during the Mexican American War. Early American newspapers depicted this in many cartoons in a biased way, justifying the take over of the land from the bad guys. These images then influenced Hollywood in film. One example is the film Red&#160;River with John Wayne. He shoots the Mexican representative of the land owner who is being provoked by John&#160;Wayne's character. The film had the representative appear peacefully at first, then out of nowhere he turns bad and tries to shoot first leading to justification of why John Wayne's character had to kill him and in doing so, John Wayne's character looked like the good guy.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Did you see any positive images of Latinos in the film? What were they and why were they positive?<ol><li>There are television shows and movies that feature Latinos in positive ways. George Lopez, Ugly Betty, Spy Kids. The were great shows that appealed to the mass market and overall there messages were good. But there are definitely too few of them and I honestly cannot believe it. But it is good to see Eva Mendez, Andy Garcia, and Michelle Rodriguez more in the mainstream.</li></ol></li>
            <li>What did the children interviewed in the film say about roles Latinos play?<ol><li>The children interviewed in the film noticed all the bad stereotypes that they should have, they are smart, and it is hurtful to see some of their reactions to a lot of the YouTube videos made by the racists. When asked about the movie "Hop", they clearly pointed out the issue that the bunnys are white and are good guys and that the chicks were the bad guys portrayed to be of Latino descent. They expressed that they would want to be the superhero as they are innocent and good-natured. One of the children, Charlie, expressed that he could not imagine a Latino as a superhero because all movies he watches all the good guys are American. Just heart-breaking.</li></ol></li>
            <li> What do you think of some the current roles for Latino actors on film and television - positive or negative? Consider the shows you watch or recent films you have seen.<ol><li>I think that some of the current roles Latinos have in film and television are more and more positive, but those same roles can also be negative in respect to there culture meaning it seems that there is always a way to slip in ethnic jokes that I am sure Latinos can relate to and laugh at, but I feel Latino viewers are also kind of sick of them. Another thing pointed out in the film is that most mainstream Latino actors are mostly light skinned. Take for example Eva Mendez, Andy Garcia, and Michelle Rodriguez, they are very popular, but maybe they are mainstream because they are light skinned and Hollywood feels that they are more appealing. than dark skinned. Not to take credit away from them for mentioning that, but I feel they are just talented people.</li></ol></li>
            <li>What do you think are some of the effects these media stereotypes have on Latinos? Provide some examples.<ol><li>I think when Latinos watch movies, TV, or other various media outlets with Latinos featured in them, that this is a good thing for them. Makes them feel more part of the community, as they should. But they (especially kids) might realize that a lot of them are popular or seen more because they appear more white-washed: have no accents, have lighter skin, etc., so this may seem to some that there is still prejudice against the darker Latinos. But I think these examples are much better than how it used to be.</li></ol></li>

        <h1 class="center">What Is Critical Thinking?
</h1>
        <p>When Arthur was in the first grade, the teacher directed the class to
“think.” “Now, class,” she said, “I know this problem is a little harder
than the ones we’ve been doing, but I’m going to give you a few extra
minutes to think about it. Now start thinking.”
</p>
        <p>It was not the first time Arthur had heard the word used. He’d heard
it many times at home, but never quite this way. The teacher seemed to be
asking for some special activity, something he should know how to start
and stop—like his father’s car. “Vroom-m-m,” he muttered half aloud.
Because of his confusion, he was unaware he was making the noise.
</p>
        <p>“Arthur, please stop making noises and start thinking.”
</p>
        <p>Embarrassed and not knowing quite what to do, he looked down at his
desk. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the little girl next to
him was staring at the ceiling. “Maybe that’s the way you start thinking,”
he guessed. He decided the others had probably learned how to do it last
year, that time he was home with the measles. So he stared at the ceiling.
</p>
        <p>As he progressed through grade school and high school, he heard
that same direction hundreds of times. “No, that’s not the answer, you’re
not thinking—now think!” And occasionally he would hear from particularly
self-pitying teachers given to muttering to themselves aloud: “What
did I do to deserve this? Don’t they teach them anything in the grades
anymore? Don’t you people care about ideas? Think, dammit, THINK.”
</p>
        <p>So Arthur learned to feel somewhat guilty about the whole matter.
Obviously, this thinking was an important activity that he’d failed to
learn. Maybe he lacked the brain power. But he was resourceful enough.
He watched the other students and did what they did. Whenever a
teacher started in about thinking, he screwed up his face, furrowed his
brow, scratched his head, stroked his chin, stared off into space or up at
the ceiling, and repeated silently to himself, “Let’s see now, I’ve got to
think about that, think, think—I hope he doesn’t call on me—think.”</p>
        <p>Though Arthur didn’t know it, that’s just what the other students were
saying to themselves.
</p>
        <p>Your experience may have been similar to Arthur’s. In other words,
many people may have simply told you to think without ever explaining
what thinking is and what qualities a good thinker has that a poor thinker
lacks. If that is the case, you have a lot of company. Extensive, effective
training in thinking is the exception rather than the rule. This fact and its
unfortunate consequences are suggested by the following comments
from accomplished observers of the human condition:
</p>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>The most interesting and astounding contradiction in life is to me the constant
insistence by nearly all people upon “logic,” “logical reasoning,”
“sound reasoning,” on the one hand, and on the other their inability to
display it, and their unwillingness to accept it when displayed by others.1
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>Most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going

        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>Clear thinking is a very rare thing, but even just plain thinking is almost
as rare. Most of us most of the time do not think at all. We believe and
we feel, but we do not think.3

        <p>All of those are just the names that thinking goes under. They really
don’t explain it. The fact is, after thousands of years of humans’ experiencing
thought and talking and writing about thinking, it remains in
many respects one of the great mysteries of our existence. Still, though
much is yet to be learned, a great deal is already known.
</p>
        <h2 class="center">Mind, Brain, or Both?
</h2>
        <p>Most modern researchers use the word mind synonymously with brain, as
if the physical organ that resides in the human skull were solely responsible
for thinking. This practice conveniently presupposes that a problem that has challenged the greatest thinkers for millennia—the relationship
between mind and physical matter—was somehow solved when no one
was looking. The problem itself and the individuals who spent their lives
wrestling with it deserve better.
</p>
        <p>Neuroscience has provided a number of valuable insights into the
cognitive or thinking activities of the brain. It has documented that the
left hemisphere of the brain deals mainly with detailed language processing
and is associated with analysis and logical thinking, that the right
hemisphere deals mainly with sensory images and is associated with intuition
and creative thinking, and that the small bundle of nerves that lies
between the hemispheres—the corpus callosum—integrates the various
functions.
</p>
        <p>The research that produced these insights showed that the brain is
necessary for thought, but it has not shown that the brain is sufficient for
thought. In fact, many philosophers claim it can never show that. They
argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas
the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to
decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity. Examine brain cells under the
most powerful microscope and you will never see an idea or concept—
for example, beauty, government, equality, or love—because ideas and
concepts are not material entities and so have no physical dimension.
Where, then, do these nonmaterial things reside? In the nonmaterial
mind.5
</p>
        <p>The late American philosopher William Barrett observed that “history
is, fundamentally, the adventure of human consciousness” and “the
fundamental history of humankind is the history of mind.” In his view,
“one of the supreme ironies of modern history” is the fact that science,
which owes its very existence to the human mind, has had the audacity to
deny the reality of the mind. As he put it, “the offspring denies the
parent.”6</p>
        <p>
The argument over whether the mind is a reality is not the only issue
about the mind that has been hotly debated over the centuries. One especially
important issue is whether the mind is passive, a blank slate on
which experience writes, as John Locke held, or active, a vehicle by which
we take the initiative and exercise our free will, as G. W. Leibnitz argued.
This book is based on the latter view.
</p>
        <h2 class="center">Critical Thinking Defined
</h2>
        <p>Let’s begin by making the important distinction between thinking and
feeling. I feel and I think are sometimes used interchangeably, but that
practice causes confusion. Feeling is a subjective response that reflects
emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously rather
than through a conscious mental act. We don’t have to employ our minds
to feel angry when we are insulted, afraid when we are threatened, or
compassionate when we see a picture of a starving child. The feelings
arise automatically.</p>
        <p>
Feeling is useful in directing our attention to matters we should think
about; it also can provide the enthusiasm and commitment necessary to
complete arduous mental tasks. However, feeling is never a good substitute
for thinking because it is notoriously unreliable. Some feelings are
beneficial, honorable, even noble; others are not, as everyday experience
demonstrates. We often feel like doing things that will harm us—for
example, smoking, sunbathing without sunscreen, telling off our professor
or employer, or spending the rent money on lottery tickets.
</p>
        <p>Zinedine Zidane was one of the greatest soccer players of his generation,
and many experts believed that in his final season (2006) he would
lead France to the pinnacle of soccer success—winning the coveted World
Cup. But then, toward the end of the championship game against Italy, he
viciously head-butted an Italian player in full view of hundreds of millions
of people. The referee banished him from the field, France lost the
match, and a single surrender to feeling forever stained the brilliant
career Zidane had dedicated his life to building.
</p>
        <p>In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed
to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding.*
Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims
beyond itself to knowledge or action. This is not to say that thinking is
infallible; in fact, a good part of this book is devoted to exposing errors in
thinking and showing you how to avoid them. Yet for all its shortcomings,
thinking is the most reliable guide to action we humans possess. To
sum up the relationship between feeling and thinking, feelings need to be
tested before being trusted, and thinking is the most reasonable and reliable
way to test them.
</p>
        <p>There are three broad categories of thinking: reflective, creative, and
critical. The focus of this book is on critical thinking. The essence of critical
thinking is evaluation. Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as
the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which
have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search
for answers, a quest. Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques
used in critical thinking is asking probing questions. Where the uncritical
accept their first thoughts and other people’s statements at face
value, critical thinkers challenge all ideas in this manner:
</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">*Some informal definitions of thinking include daydreaming. It is excluded from this definition
because daydreaming is a passive mental state over which we exercise little or no control.
It is therefore of little use in evaluating ideas.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Critical thinking also employs questions to analyze issues. Consider,
for example, the subject of values. When it is being discussed, some people
say, “Our country has lost its traditional values” and “There would be
less crime, especially violent crime, if parents and teachers emphasized
moral values.” Critical thinking would prompt us to ask,
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the relationship between values and beliefs? Between values
and convictions?
</li>
            <li>Are all values valuable?
</li>
            <li>How aware is the average person of his or her values? Is it possible
that many people deceive themselves about their real values?</li>
            <li>Where do one’s values originate? Within the individual or outside?
In thought or in feeling?</li>
            <li>Does education change a person’s values? If so, is this change always
for the better?
</li>
            <li>Should parents and teachers attempt to shape children’s values?
</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="center">Characteristics of Critical Thinkers
</h2>
        <p>A number of misconceptions exist about critical thinking. One is that
being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker.
Virtually everyone has reasons, however weak they may be. The test of
critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.
</p>
        <p>Another misconception is that critical thinkers never imitate others in
thought or action. If that were the case, then every eccentric would be a
critical thinker. Critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless
of how common or uncommon those decisions are.</p>
        <p>It is also a misconception that critical thinking is synonymous with
having a lot of right answers in one’s head. There’s nothing wrong with
having right answers, of course. But critical thinking involves the process
of finding answers when they are not so readily available.
</p>
        <p>And yet another misconception is that critical thinking cannot be
learned, that one either has it or does not. On the contrary, critical thinking
is a matter of habit. The most careless, sloppy thinker can become a
critical thinker by developing the characteristics of a critical thinker. This
is not to say that all people have equal thinking potential but rather that
everyone can achieve dramatic improvement.
</p>
        <p>We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers—skill in
asking appropriate questions. Another is control of one’s mental activities.
John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us
care to admit is spent “trifling with mental pictures, random recollections,
pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.”
7 Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned
better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious drift of
images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter,
examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, in
other words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their minds actively
as well as passively.
</p>
        <p>Here are some additional characteristics of critical thinkers, as contrasted
with those of uncritical thinkers:</p>

        <p>As the desirable qualities suggest, critical thinking depends on mental
discipline. Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct
their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold their
endorsement of any idea—even their own—until they have tested and
confirmed it. John Dewey equated this mental discipline with freedom.
That is, he argued that people who do not have it are not free persons but
slaves to whim or circumstance:
</p>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>If a man’s actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, then they
are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or
the circumstances of the moment. To cultivate unhindered, unreflective
external activity is to foster enslavement, for it leaves the person at the
mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance.8</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 class="center">
The Role of Intuition
</h2>
        <p>Intuition is commonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension
of something—that is, sensing or understanding something
without the use of reasoning. Some everyday experiences seem to support
this definition. You may have met a stranger and instantly “known”
that you would be partners for life. When a car salesman told you
that the price he was quoting you was his final, rock-bottom price,
your intuition may have told you he was lying. On the first day of a
particular course, you may have had a strong sense that you would not
do well in it.
</p>
        <p>Some important discoveries seem to have occurred instantaneously.
For example, the German chemist Kekule found the solution to a difficult
chemical problem intuitively. He was very tired when he slipped into a daydream. The image of a snake swallowing its tail came to him—and
that provided the clue to the structure of the benzene molecule, which is
a ring, rather than a chain, of atoms.9 The German writer Goethe had
been experiencing great difficulty organizing a large mass of material
for one of his works when he learned of the tragic suicide of a close
friend. At that very instant, the plan for organizing his material occurred
to him in detail.10 The English writer Samuel Taylor Coleridge (you
may have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner in high school) awoke
from a dream with 200–300 lines of a new and complex poem clearly
in mind.
</p>
        <p>Such examples seem to suggest that intuition is very different from
reasoning and is not influenced by it. But before accepting that conclusion,
consider these facts:
</p>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>Breakthrough ideas favor trained, active minds. It is unusual for
someone totally untrained in a subject to make a significant new discovery
about it. Thus, if Kekule had been a plumber, Goethe a bookkeeper,
and Coleridge a hairdresser, they would almost certainly not
have received the intuitions for which they are famous.
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>Some intuitions eventually prove to be mistaken. That attractive
stranger may turn out to be not your lifelong partner but a person
for whom you develop a strong dislike. The car salesman’s final
price may have proved to be exactly that. And instead of doing
poorly in that course, you may have done well.
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the quality of our intuitions
because we tend to forget the ones that prove mistaken in much
the same way a gambler forgets his losses.
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>These facts have led some scholars to conclude that intuition is simply
a consequence of thinking. They would say that something about the
stranger appealed to you, something the salesman said or did suggested
insincerity, something about the professor frightened you. In each case,
they would explain, you made a quick decision—so quick, in fact, that
you were unaware that you’d been thinking. In the case of the breakthrough
ideas, the scholars would say that when people become engrossed
in problems or issues, their unconscious minds often continue
working on them long after they have turned their attention elsewhere.
Thus, when an insight seems to come “out of nowhere,” it is actually a
delayed result of thinking.
</p>
        <p>Which view of intuitions is the correct one? Are intuitions different
from and independent of thinking or not? Perhaps, for now, the most prudent
answer is that sometimes they are independent and sometimes they
are not; we can’t be sure when they are, and therefore it is imprudent to
rely on them.</p>

        <p>As we noted previously, irresponsible thinkers first choose their conclusions
and then seek out evidence to justify their choices. They fail to
realize that the only conclusion worth drawing is one based on a thorough
understanding of the problem or issue and its possible solutions or
resolutions. Is it acceptable to speculate, guess, and form hunches and hypotheses?
Absolutely. Such activities provide a helpful starting point for
the thinking process. (Besides, we couldn’t avoid doing so even if we
tried.) The crucial thing is not to let hunches and hypotheses manipulate
our thinking and dictate our conclusion in advance.
</p>
        <h2 class="center">Critical Thinking and Writing
</h2>
        <p>Writing may be used for either of two broad purposes: to discover ideas
or to communicate them. Most of the writing you have done in school is
undoubtedly the latter kind. But the former can be very helpful, not only
in sorting out ideas you’ve already produced, but also in stimulating the
flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea
seems to generate additional ideas.
</p>
        <p>Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examining
and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don’t
worry about organization or correctness. If ideas come slowly, be patient.
If they come suddenly, in a rush, don’t try to slow down the process and
develop any one of them; simply jot them all down. (There will be time for
elaboration and correction later.) Direct your mind’s effort, but be sensitive
to ideas on the fringe of consciousness. Often they, too, will prove valuable.
</p>
        <p>If you have done your discovery writing well and have thought
critically about the ideas you have produced, the task of writing to communicate will be easier and more enjoyable. You will have many
more ideas—carefully evaluated ones—to develop and organize.
</p>
        <h2 class="center">Critical Thinking and Discussion11
</h2>
        <p>At its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem
solving and decision making. At its worst, it frays nerves, creates animosity,
and leaves important issues unresolved. Unfortunately, the most prominent
models for discussion in contemporary culture—radio and TV
talk shows—often produce the latter effects.
</p>
        <p>Many hosts demand that their guests answer complex questions with
simple “yes” or “no” answers. If the guests respond that way, they are attacked
for oversimplifying. If, instead, they try to offer a balanced answer,
the host shouts, “You’re not answering the question,” and proceeds to answer
it himself. Guests who agree with the host are treated warmly; others
are dismissed as ignorant or dishonest. Often as not, when two guests are
debating, each takes a turn interrupting while the other shouts, “Let
me finish.” Neither shows any desire to learn from the other. Typically, as
the show draws to a close, the host thanks the participants for a “vigorous
debate” and promises the audience more of the same next time.
</p>
        <p>Here are some simple guidelines for ensuring that the discussions
you engage in—in the classroom, on the job, or at home—are more civil,
meaningful, and productive than what you see on TV. By following these
guidelines, you will set a good example for the people around you.
</p>
        <p><b>Whenever possible, prepare in advance.</b> Not every discussion can
be prepared for in advance, but many can. An agenda is usually circulated
several days before a business or committee meeting. In college
courses, the assignment schedule provides a reliable indication of what
will be discussed in class on a given day. Use this information to prepare:
Begin by reflecting on what you already know about the topic. Then decide
how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.
(Fifteen or twenty minutes of focused searching in the library or on the
Internet can produce a significant amount of information on almost any
subject.) Try to anticipate the different points of view that might be
expressed in the discussion and consider the relative merits of each. Keep
your conclusions tentative at this point, so that you will be open to the
facts and interpretations others will present.
</p>
        <p><b>Set reasonable expectations.</b> Have you ever left a discussion disappointed
that others hadn’t abandoned their views and embraced yours?
Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked
you what evidence you had to support your opinion? If the answer to either
question is yes, you probably expect too much of others. People seldom change
their minds easily or quickly, particularly in the case of long-held convictions.</p>
        <p>And when they encounter ideas that differ from their own, they naturally
want to know what evidence supports those ideas. Expect to have your
ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.
</p>
        <p><b>Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.</b> To be productive,
discussion requires an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility. Egotism
produces disrespectful attitudes toward others—notably, “I’m more
important than other people,” “My ideas are better than anyone else’s,” and
“Rules don’t apply to me.” Personal agendas, such as dislike for another
participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal
attacks and unwillingness to listen to others’ views.
</p>
        <p><b>Contribute but don’t dominate.</b> If you are the kind of person who
loves to talk and has a lot to say, you probably contribute more to discussions
than other participants. On the other hand, if you are more reserved,
you may seldom say anything. There is nothing wrong with
being either kind of person. However, discussions tend to be most productive
when everyone contributes ideas. For this to happen, loquacious
people need to exercise a little restraint, and more reserved people need
to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts.
</p>
        <p><b>Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.</b> Such mannerisms include
starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or
slurring your words; and punctuating every phrase or clause with audible
pauses (“um,” “ah,”) or meaningless expressions (“like,” “you know,”
“man”). These annoying mannerisms distract people from your message.
To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape
your conversations with friends and family (with their permission), then
play the tape back and listen to yourself. Whenever you are engaged in a
discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.</p>
        <p><![CDATA[
]]><b>Listen actively.</b> When the participants don’t listen to one another,
discussion becomes little more than serial monologue—each person taking
a turn at speaking while the rest ignore what is being said. This can
happen quite unintentionally because the mind can process ideas faster
than the fastest speaker can deliver them. Your mind may get tired of
waiting and wander about aimlessly like a dog off its leash. In such cases,
instead of listening to the speaker’s words, you may think about her
clothing or hairstyle or look outside the window and observe what is
happening there. Even when you make a serious effort to listen, it is easy
to lose focus. If the speaker’s words trigger an unrelated memory, you
may slip away to that earlier time and place. If the speaker says something
you disagree with, you may begin framing a reply. The best way to
maintain your attention is to be alert for such distractions and to resist
them. Strive to enter the speaker’s frame of mind, understand what is
said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize
your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.</p>
        <p><b>Judge ideas responsibly.</b> Ideas range in quality from profound to
ridiculous, helpful to harmful, ennobling to degrading. It is therefore appropriate
to pass judgment on them. However, fairness demands that
you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall
strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings.
Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliar or different from
your own because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a
fair hearing.
</p>
        <p><b>Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.</b> No doubt you understand that
shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do
you realize that in many cases they are also a sign of intellectual insecurity?
It’s true. If you really believe your ideas are sound, you will have no
need to raise your voice or to silence the other person. Even if the other
person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence
and character is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree
without being disagreeable.
</p>
        <h2 class="center">Avoiding Plagiarism12</h2>
        <p>Once ideas are put into words and published, they become intellectual
property, and the author has the same rights over them as he or she has
over a material possession such as a house or a car. The only real difference
is that intellectual property is purchased with mental effort rather
than money. Anyone who has ever wracked his or her brain trying to
solve a problem or trying to put an idea into clear and meaningful words
can appreciate how difficult mental effort can be.
</p>
        <p>Plagiarism is passing off other people’s ideas or words as one’s own.
It is doubly offensive in that it both steals and deceives. In the academic
world, plagiarism is considered an ethical violation and is punished by a
failing grade for a paper or a course or even by dismissal from the institution.
Outside the academy, it is a crime that can be prosecuted if the person
to whom the ideas and words belong wishes to bring charges. Either
way, the offender suffers dishonor and disgrace, as the following examples
illustrate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> When a university in South Africa learned that professor Marks
Chabel had plagiarized most of his doctoral dissertation from
Kimberly Lanegran of the University of Florida, the university fired
Chabel. Moreover, the university that had awarded him his Ph.D.
revoked it.</li>
            <li>When U.S. Senator Joseph Biden was seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, it was revealed that he had plagiarized passages
from speeches by British politician Neil Kinnock and by Robert Kennedy.
It was also learned that, while in law school, he had plagiarized a number of pages from a legal article. The ensuing scandal led Biden to
withdraw his candidacy and has continued to stain his reputation.
</li>
            <li>The reputation of historian Stephen Ambrose was tarnished by allegations
that over the years he plagiarized the work of several authors.
Doris Kearns Goodwin, historian and advisor to President Lyndon
Johnson, suffered a similar embarrassment when she was discovered
to have plagiarized from more than one source in one of her books.
</li>
            <li>When James A. Mackay, a Scottish historian, published a biography
of Alexander Graham Bell in 1998, Robert Bruce presented evidence
that the book was largely plagiarized from his 1973 biography,
which had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mackay was forced to withdraw his
book from the market. (Incredibly, he did not learn from the experience
because he then published a biography of John Paul Jones,
which was plagiarized from a 1942 book by Samuel Eliot Morison.)
</li>
            <li> When New York Times reporter Jason Blair was discovered to have
plagiarized stories from other reporters and fabricated quotations
and details in his stories, he resigned his position in disgrace. Soon
afterward, the two senior editors who had been his closest mentors
also resigned, reportedly because of their irresponsible handling of
Blair’s reportage and the subsequent scandal.
</li>
            <li>Some cases of plagiarism are attributable to intentional dishonesty,
others to carelessness. But many, perhaps most, are due to misunderstanding.
The instructions “Base your paper on research rather than on
your own unfounded opinions” and “Don’t present other people’s ideas
as your own” seem contradictory and may confuse students, especially if
no clarification is offered. Fortunately, there is a way to honor both instructions
and, in the process, to avoid plagiarism.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Step 1:</i> When you are researching a topic, keep your sources’ ideas
separate from your own. Begin by keeping a record of each source of
information you consult. For an Internet source, record the Web site
address, the author and title of the item, and the date you visited the site.
For a book, record the author, title, place of publication, publisher, and
date of publication. For a magazine or journal article, record the author,
title, the name of the publication, and its date of issue. For a TV or radio
broadcast, record the program title, station, and date of transmission.
</p>
        <p><i>Step 2:</i> As you read each source, note the ideas you want to refer to in
your writing. If the author’s words are unusually clear and concise, copy
them exactly and put quotation marks around them. Otherwise, paraphrase—
that is, restate the author’s ideas in your own words. Write down the number(
s) of the page(s) on which the author’s passage appears.
If the author’s idea triggers a response in your mind—such as a question,
a connection between this idea and something else you’ve read, or
an experience of your own that supports or challenges what the author
says—write it down and put brackets (not parentheses) around it so that</p>
        <p>you will be able to identify it as your own when you review your notes.
Here is a sample research record illustrating these two steps:
</p>
        <blockquote class="name">
            <p>Adler, Mortimer J. The Great Ideas: A Lexicon of Western Thought (New York:
Macmillan, 1992) Says that throughout the ages, from ancient Greece,
philosophers have argued about whether various ideas are true. Says it’s
remarkable that most renowned thinkers have agreed about what truth
is—”a correspondence between thought and reality.” 867 Also says that
Freud saw this as the scientific view of truth. Quotes Freud: “This correspondence
with the real external world we call truth. It is the aim of scientific
work, even when the practical value of that work does not interest
us.” 869 [I say true statements fit the facts; false statements do not.]
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Whenever you look back on this record, even a year from now, you
will be able to tell at a glance which ideas and words are the author’s and
which are yours. The first three sentences are, with the exception of the
directly quoted part, paraphrases of the author’s ideas. Next is a direct
quotation. The final sentence, in brackets, is your own idea.
</p>
        <p><i>Step 3: </i>When you compose your paper, work borrowed ideas and
words into your own writing by judicious use of quoting and paraphrasing.
In addition, give credit to the various authors. Your goal here is to
eliminate all doubt about which ideas and words belong to whom. In formal
presentations, this crediting is done in footnotes; in informal ones, it
is done simply by mentioning the author’s name.
</p>
        <p>Here is an example of how the material from Mortimer Adler might be
worked into a composition. (Note the form that is used for the footnote.)
The second paragraph illustrates how your own idea might be expanded:
</p>
        <p>Mortimer J. Adler explains that throughout the ages, from the time of
the ancient Greeks, philosophers have argued about whether various
ideas are true. But to Adler the remarkable thing is that, even as they
argued, most renowned thinkers have agreed about what truth is. They
saw it as “a correspondence between thought and reality.” Adler points
out that Sigmund Freud believed this was also the scientific view of
truth. He quotes Freud as follows: “This correspondence with the real
external world we call truth. It is the aim of scientific work, even when
the practical value of that work does not interest us.”*
</p>
        <p>This correspondence view of truth is consistent with the commonsense
rule that a statement is true if it fits the facts and false if it does not. For
example, the statement “The twin towers of New York’s World Trade
Center were destroyed on September 11, 2002,” is false because they were
destroyed the previous year. I may sincerely believe that it is true, but
my believing in no way affects the truth of the matter. In much the same
way, if an innocent man is convicted of a crime, neither the court’s decision
nor the world’s acceptance of it will make him any less innocent. We
may be free to think what we wish, but our thinking can’t alter reality.

        <h2 class="center">Applications
</h2>
        <p>1. Think back on your previous schooling. How closely has your experience
matched Arthur’s? Explain.
</p>
        <p>2. Reflect on your powers of concentration. Do you find it difficult to ponder
important matters? Are you able to prevent the casual, semiconscious drift of
images from interrupting your thoughts? Do you have less control in some situations
than in others? Explain.
</p>
        <p>3. Rate yourself on each of the eight characteristics of good critical thinkers
that are listed on pp. 24–26. Which are you strongest in? Which weakest? If your
behavior varies from situation to situation, try to determine what kinds of issues
or circumstances bring out your best and worst mental qualities.
</p>
        <p>4. Consider how you approach problems and issues. Is there any pattern to
the way you think about a problem or an issue? Does an image come to mind
first? Or perhaps a word? What comes next? And what after that? If you can’t
answer these questions completely, do this exercise: Flip half a dozen pages ahead
in this book, pick a sentence at random, read it, and note how your mind deals
with it. (Such thinking about your thinking may be a little awkward at first. If it
is, try the exercise two or three times.)
</p>
        <p>5. Read each of the following statements carefully. Then decide what question(
s), if any, a good critical thinker would find it appropriate to ask.
</p>
        <p>a. Television news sensationalizes its treatment of war because it gives us
pictures only of injury, death, and destruction.
</p>
        <p>b. My parents were too strict—they wouldn’t let me date until I was sixteen.
</p>
        <p>c. It’s clear to me that Ralph doesn’t care for me—he never speaks when we
pass in the hall.
</p>
        <p>d. From a commercial for a news network: “The news is changing every
minute of the day, so you constantly need updating to keep you informed.”
</p>
        <p>e. The statement of an Alabama public elementary school teacher who had
students recite the Lord’s Prayer and say grace before meals: “I feel part
of my job as a teacher is to instill values children need to have a good
life.”
</p>
        <h2 class="center">A Difference of Opinion
</h2>
        <p>The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After
reading the statement, use the library and/or the Internet and find what knowledgeable
people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range
of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude
that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you
reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more
insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct
a view of your own that combines the insights from all views and explain why
that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or
an oral report, as your instructor specifies.
</p>
        <p><strong>What response should the United States make to the problem of illegal
immigration?</strong> As violence on the southern U.S. border increases and illegal
entry continues, many Americans are becoming impatient with the federal government’s failure to solve the border problem. The state of Arizona has
already taken action to apprehend illegals but has been criticized for interfering
in matters under federal jurisdiction. Is Arizona’s approach the most
reasonable one? If not, what approach would be?
</p>
        <p>Begin your analysis by conducting a Google search using the terms “Arizona
illegal immigrants” and “border security issues.”</p>

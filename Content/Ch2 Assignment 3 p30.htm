        <h1>Ch2 Assignment 3 p30</h1>
        <p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">3. Rate yourself on each of the eight characteristics of good critical thinkers
that are listed on pp. 24–26. Which are you strongest in? Which weakest? If your
behavior varies from situation to situation, try to determine what kinds of issues
or circumstances bring out your best and worst mental qualities.

        <p><b>Whenever possible, prepare in advance.</b> Not every discussion can
be prepared for in advance, but many can. An agenda is usually circulated
several days before a business or committee meeting. In college
courses, the assignment schedule provides a reliable indication of what
will be discussed in class on a given day. Use this information to prepare:
Begin by reflecting on what you already know about the topic. Then decide
how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.
(Fifteen or twenty minutes of focused searching in the library or on the
Internet can produce a significant amount of information on almost any
subject.) Try to anticipate the different points of view that might be
expressed in the discussion and consider the relative merits of each. Keep
your conclusions tentative at this point, so that you will be open to the
facts and interpretations others will present.
</p>
        <p class="Example">This is usually a strong area of mine because I believe this is one of the most import characteristic of a good thinker. Without preparing I am lost, which may seem weak, but since I avoid it that keeps me on top of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Set reasonable expectations.</b> Have you ever left a discussion disappointed
that others hadn’t abandoned their views and embraced yours?
Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked
you what evidence you had to support your opinion? If the answer to either
question is yes, you probably expect too much of others. People seldom change
their minds easily or quickly, particularly in the case of long-held convictions.</p>
        <p>And when they encounter ideas that differ from their own, they naturally
want to know what evidence supports those ideas. Expect to have your
ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I&#160;would say this is one of my weakest areas. I tend to think I did not express myself as good as I should have. But then again it is a fine line between thinking that and realizing that my idea was good, but there is a better one, a more feasible one.</p>
        <p><b>Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.</b> To be productive,
discussion requires an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility. Egotism
produces disrespectful attitudes toward others—notably, “I’m more
important than other people,” “My ideas are better than anyone else’s,” and
“Rules don’t apply to me.” Personal agendas, such as dislike for another
participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal
attacks and unwillingness to listen to others’ views.
</p>
        <p class="Example">&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Contribute but don’t dominate.</b> If you are the kind of person who
loves to talk and has a lot to say, you probably contribute more to discussions
than other participants. On the other hand, if you are more reserved,
you may seldom say anything. There is nothing wrong with
being either kind of person. However, discussions tend to be most productive
when everyone contributes ideas. For this to happen, loquacious
people need to exercise a little restraint, and more reserved people need
to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts.
</p>
        <p class="Example">&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.</b> Such mannerisms include
starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or
slurring your words; and punctuating every phrase or clause with audible
pauses (“um,” “ah,”) or meaningless expressions (“like,” “you know,”
“man”). These annoying mannerisms distract people from your message.
To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape
your conversations with friends and family (with their permission), then
play the tape back and listen to yourself. Whenever you are engaged in a
discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.</p>
        <p class="Example">&#160;</p>
        <p><![CDATA[
]]><b>Listen actively.</b> When the participants don’t listen to one another,
discussion becomes little more than serial monologue—each person taking
a turn at speaking while the rest ignore what is being said. This can
happen quite unintentionally because the mind can process ideas faster
than the fastest speaker can deliver them. Your mind may get tired of
waiting and wander about aimlessly like a dog off its leash. In such cases,
instead of listening to the speaker’s words, you may think about her
clothing or hairstyle or look outside the window and observe what is
happening there. Even when you make a serious effort to listen, it is easy
to lose focus. If the speaker’s words trigger an unrelated memory, you
may slip away to that earlier time and place. If the speaker says something
you disagree with, you may begin framing a reply. The best way to
maintain your attention is to be alert for such distractions and to resist
them. Strive to enter the speaker’s frame of mind, understand what is
said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize
your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.</p>
        <p class="Example">&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Judge ideas responsibly.</b> Ideas range in quality from profound to
ridiculous, helpful to harmful, ennobling to degrading. It is therefore appropriate
to pass judgment on them. However, fairness demands that
you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall
strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings.
Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliar or different from
your own because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a
fair hearing.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I feel I am very strong in this area. I have encountered many people that I don't agree with, maybe their ideas were off point, or a bad idea with potential consequences, or even ideas that were not really thought out completely. But the trick is to consider it, talk about it and maybe point out things that might help their ideas. I surely have been on the other end of that too, that is how you learn.</p>
        <p><b>Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.</b> No doubt you understand that
shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do
you realize that in many cases they are also a sign of intellectual insecurity?
It’s true. If you really believe your ideas are sound, you will have no
need to raise your voice or to silence the other person. Even if the other
person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence
and character is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree
without being disagreeable.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I&#160;am very good in this area because I feel respectable to all, even if they are disrespectful. This is just in my nature and it benefits me tremendously.</p>

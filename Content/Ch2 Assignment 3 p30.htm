        <h1>Ch2 Assignment 3 p30</h1>
        <p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">3. Rate yourself on each of the eight characteristics of good critical thinkers
that are listed on pp. 24–26. Which are you strongest in? Which weakest? If your
behavior varies from situation to situation, try to determine what kinds of issues
or circumstances bring out your best and worst mental qualities.

        <p>The eight characteristics of good critical thinkers: "Whenever possible, prepare in advance", "Set reasonable expectations", "Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door", "Contribute but don’t dominate", "Avoid distracting speech mannerisms", 
"Listen actively", "Judge ideas responsibly", and "Keep your calm".</p>
        <p><b>Whenever possible, prepare in advance.</b> Not every discussion can
be prepared for in advance, but many can. An agenda is usually circulated
several days before a business or committee meeting. In college
courses, the assignment schedule provides a reliable indication of what
will be discussed in class on a given day. Use this information to prepare:
Begin by reflecting on what you already know about the topic. Then decide
how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.
(Fifteen or twenty minutes of focused searching in the library or on the
Internet can produce a significant amount of information on almost any
subject.) Try to anticipate the different points of view that might be
expressed in the discussion and consider the relative merits of each. Keep
your conclusions tentative at this point, so that you will be open to the
facts and interpretations others will present.
</p>
        <p class="Example">Preparing in advance is a strong area of mine and I believe this is one of the most import characteristics of a good thinker. Personally without preparing properly for a discussion or meeting I tend to get lost in translation. It is a fantastic tool for one to reflect on a topic and map out how they want to address it.</p>
        <p><b>Set reasonable expectations.</b> Have you ever left a discussion disappointed
that others hadn’t abandoned their views and embraced yours?
Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked
you what evidence you had to support your opinion? If the answer to either
question is yes, you probably expect too much of others. People seldom change
their minds easily or quickly, particularly in the case of long-held convictions.</p>
        <p>And when they encounter ideas that differ from their own, they naturally
want to know what evidence supports those ideas. Expect to have your
ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.
</p>
        <p class="Example">Setting reasonable expectations is an area where I am strong and weak. I believe I am strong in the sense that when others don't abandon their views, I realize quickly why and learn from it, meaning they may have a more practical idea. I may be a little weak sometimes thinking that I did not express myself as good as I should have. But then again it is a fine line between thinking that and realizing that my idea was good, but there is a better one, a more feasible one.</p>
        <p><b>Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.</b> To be productive,
discussion requires an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility. Egotism
produces disrespectful attitudes toward others—notably, “I’m more
important than other people,” “My ideas are better than anyone else’s,” and
“Rules don’t apply to me.” Personal agendas, such as dislike for another
participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal
attacks and unwillingness to listen to others’ views.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I never really have an issue with leaving my ego and personal agendas at the door. This is important because you never want to create a bad image of yourself, or even offend others by having erratic behavior because of you. You always want to appear as calm and collected.</p>
        <p><b>Contribute but don’t dominate.</b> If you are the kind of person who
loves to talk and has a lot to say, you probably contribute more to discussions
than other participants. On the other hand, if you are more reserved,
you may seldom say anything. There is nothing wrong with
being either kind of person. However, discussions tend to be most productive
when everyone contributes ideas. For this to happen, loquacious
people need to exercise a little restraint, and more reserved people need
to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts.
</p>
        <p class="Example">Regarding "Contribute but don’t dominate". This is an area where I am very weak. I am very shy and have trouble speaking up as I fear sounding incompetent or having half-baked ideas. I have been trying to overcome this and I am doing a good jobs over the years since I have been more involved with projects that obviously have stakeholders who need to know the ins and outs of certain topics being discussed.</p>
        <p><b>Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.</b> Such mannerisms include
starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or
slurring your words; and punctuating every phrase or clause with audible
pauses (“um,” “ah,”) or meaningless expressions (“like,” “you know,”
“man”). These annoying mannerisms distract people from your message.
To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape
your conversations with friends and family (with their permission), then
play the tape back and listen to yourself. Whenever you are engaged in a
discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.</p>
        <p class="Example">I do my best to avoid distracting speech mannerisms. I was taught by my father very early on in life that I better never use "like" or "um" when talking, that it is distracting to the listener and makes one sound like they do not know what they are talking about. I find that I tend to do it once and a while, but I strive not to.</p>
        <p><![CDATA[
]]><b>Listen actively.</b> When the participants don’t listen to one another,
discussion becomes little more than serial monologue—each person taking
a turn at speaking while the rest ignore what is being said. This can
happen quite unintentionally because the mind can process ideas faster
than the fastest speaker can deliver them. Your mind may get tired of
waiting and wander about aimlessly like a dog off its leash. In such cases,
instead of listening to the speaker’s words, you may think about her
clothing or hairstyle or look outside the window and observe what is
happening there. Even when you make a serious effort to listen, it is easy
to lose focus. If the speaker’s words trigger an unrelated memory, you
may slip away to that earlier time and place. If the speaker says something
you disagree with, you may begin framing a reply. The best way to
maintain your attention is to be alert for such distractions and to resist
them. Strive to enter the speaker’s frame of mind, understand what is
said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize
your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.</p>
        <p class="Example">Listening actively is something that grows on you if you do not learn it. There are many times where I would fade out because I know what a speaker is going to say, but then when you come back you realize you missed something important. I am very good at this because I have learned my lessons on how important this is to being a critical thinker, because listening is key.</p>
        <p><b>Judge ideas responsibly.</b> Ideas range in quality from profound to
ridiculous, helpful to harmful, ennobling to degrading. It is therefore appropriate
to pass judgment on them. However, fairness demands that
you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall
strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings.
Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliar or different from
your own because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a
fair hearing.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I feel I am very strong in judging ideas responsibly. I have encountered many people that I don't agree with, maybe their ideas were off point, or had an idea with potential consequences, or even ideas that were not really thought out completely. But the trick is to consider it, talk about it, and maybe point out things that might help their ideas to be more fully baked. I surely have been on the other end of that too, and that is how you learn how to think better. It is important to address these things to help others.</p>
        <p><b>Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.</b> No doubt you understand that
shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do
you realize that in many cases they are also a sign of intellectual insecurity?
It’s true. If you really believe your ideas are sound, you will have no
need to raise your voice or to silence the other person. Even if the other
person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence
and character is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree
without being disagreeable.
</p>
        <p class="Example">I&#160;am very good in this area but it is sometimes hard to resist the urge to shout or interrupt because you may be excited about the topic. I feel it is that you really have to be respectful to all, even if they are disrespectful. This is just in my nature and it benefits me tremendously.</p>
